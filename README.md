# DataStructuresPython
- You'll find Data Structures/ Algorithm problems from Leetcode.

## 1. Arrays
- Suppose you had a bunch of DVDs at home that you wanted to arrange neatly. What would be the ideal choice for storing such a thing? <br>
- You could find a cardboard box (or some other box) big enough to arrange all of the DVDs neatly, right? It's as simple as that. <br>
- However, you might want to add a new DVD to the box, or you might want to get rid of the old ones that you've watched a million times over in the past. <br>


> The two most primitive Array operations are writing elements into them, and reading elements from them. All other Array operations are built on top of these two primitive operations. <br>


* We usually use _for loop_ to write and read data from the Array. <br>

## 2. Linked List
#### - Singly LinkedList <br>
   - Singly linkedlist have a data node and a pointer to the next node. <br>
        * Operations performed: <br>
 	        - find(data) <br>
            - get_size() <br>
            - add(data) <br>
            - remove(data)
